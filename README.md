# VOIDRUN
A human-first terminal layer: ritualized startup, reflective logging, glitch/retro aesthetics, and safe backups.

## Quick start (manual install)
- Save scripts locally (see `scripts/`) and make them executable.
- Add the `.desktop` shortcut if you want a double-click launcher.
- Optional: use `install.sh` for one-shot setup.

## Roadmap
- v0.1: Splash, Retro/Glitch modes, Reflect/Startday, Safe .bashrc backup/restore
- v0.2: VOIDMAIL, Itch/Substack launcher, theme packs
- v0.3: .deb packaging & Plymouth theme
